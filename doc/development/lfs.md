# Git LFS

## Deep Dive

In April 2019, Francisco Javier LÃ³pez hosted a Deep Dive (GitLab team members only: `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/issues/1`)
on GitLab's [Git LFS](../topics/git/lfs/index.md) implementation to share his domain
specific knowledge with anyone who may work in this part of the code base in the future.
You can find the [recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyxwcksr0Qc),
and the slides on [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E-aw6-z0rYd0346YhIWE7E9A65zISL9iIMAOq2zaw9E/edit)
and in [PDF](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/uploads/07a89257a140db067bdfb484aecd35e1/Git_LFS_Deep_Dive__Create_.pdf).
Everything covered in this deep dive was accurate as of GitLab 11.10, and while specific
details may have changed since then, it should still serve as a good introduction.
