# Instance Statistics

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235754) in GitLab 13.4.

Instance Statistics gives you an overview of how much data your instance contains, and how quickly this volume is changing over time.

## Total counts

At the top of the page, Instance Statistics shows total counts for:

- Users
- Projects
- Groups
- Issues
- Merge Requests
- Pipelines

These figures can be useful for understanding how much data your instance contains in total.
