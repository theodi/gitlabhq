## Create a backup of the GitLab system

A backup creates an archive file that contains the database, all repositories and all attachments.
This archive will be saved in backup_path (see `config/gitlab.yml`).
The filename will be `[TIMESTAMP]_gitlab_backup.tar`. This timestamp can be used to restore an specific backup.
You can only restore a backup to exactly the same version of GitLab that you created it on, for example 7.2.1.

If you are interested in GitLab CI backup please follow to the [CI backup documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci/blob/master/doc/raketasks/backup_restore.md)*

```
# use this command if you've installed GitLab with the Omnibus package
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:create

# if you've installed GitLab from source
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:backup:create RAILS_ENV=production
```

Also you can choose what should be backed up by adding environment variable SKIP. Available options: db, 
uploads (attachments), repositories. Use a comma to specify several options at the same time.

```
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:create SKIP=db,uploads
```

## Upload backups to remote (cloud) storage

Starting with GitLab 7.4 you can let the backup script upload the '.tar' file it creates.
It uses the [Fog library](http://fog.io/) to perform the upload.
In the example below we use Amazon S3 for storage.
But Fog also lets you use [other storage providers](http://fog.io/storage/).

For omnibus packages:

```ruby
gitlab_rails['backup_upload_connection'] = {
  'provider' => 'AWS',
  'region' => 'eu-west-1',
  'aws_access_key_id' => 'AKIAKIAKI',
  'aws_secret_access_key' => 'secret123'
}
gitlab_rails['backup_upload_remote_directory'] = 'my.s3.bucket'
```

For installations from source:

```yaml
  backup:
    # snip
    upload:
      # Fog storage connection settings, see http://fog.io/storage/ .
      connection:
        provider: AWS
        region: eu-west-1
        aws_access_key_id: AKIAKIAKI
        aws_secret_access_key: 'secret123'
      # The remote 'directory' to store your backups. For S3, this would be the bucket name.
      remote_directory: 'my.s3.bucket'
```

If you are uploading your backups to S3 you will probably want to create a new
IAM user with restricted access rights. To give the upload user access only for
uploading backups create the following IAM profile, replacing `my.s3.bucket`
with the name of your bucket:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1412062044000",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
        "s3:GetBucketAcl",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:GetObjectAcl",
        "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my.s3.bucket/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1412062097000",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetBucketLocation",
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1412062128000",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my.s3.bucket"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Storing configuration files

Please be informed that a backup does not store your configuration files.
If you use an Omnibus package please see the [instructions in the readme to backup your configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/README.md#backup-and-restore-omnibus-gitlab-configuration).
If you have a cookbook installation there should be a copy of your configuration in Chef.
If you have an installation from source, please consider backing up your `gitlab.yml` file, any SSL keys and certificates, and your [SSH host keys](https://superuser.com/questions/532040/copy-ssh-keys-from-one-server-to-another-server/532079#532079).

## Restore a previously created backup

You can only restore a backup to exactly the same version of GitLab that you created it on, for example 7.2.1.

### Installation from source

```
bundle exec rake gitlab:backup:restore RAILS_ENV=production
```

Options:

```
BACKUP=timestamp_of_backup (required if more than one backup exists)
force=yes (do not ask if the authorized_keys file should get regenerated)
```

Example output:

```
Unpacking backup... [DONE]

```

### Omnibus installations

We will assume that you have installed GitLab from an omnibus package and run
`sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure` at least once.

First make sure your backup tar file is in `/var/opt/gitlab/backups`.

```shell
sudo cp 1393513186_gitlab_backup.tar /var/opt/gitlab/backups/
```

Next, restore the backup by running the restore command. You need to specify the
timestamp of the backup you are restoring.

```shell
# Stop processes that are connected to the database
sudo gitlab-ctl stop unicorn
sudo gitlab-ctl stop sidekiq

# This command will overwrite the contents of your GitLab database!
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:restore BACKUP=1393513186

# Start GitLab
sudo gitlab-ctl start

# Create satellites
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:satellites:create

# Check GitLab
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:check SANITIZE=true
```

If there is a GitLab version mismatch between your backup tar file and the installed
version of GitLab, the restore command will abort with an error. Install a package for
the [required version](https://www.gitlab.com/downloads/archives/) and try again.

## Configure cron to make daily backups

### For installation from source:
```
cd /home/git/gitlab
sudo -u git -H editor config/gitlab.yml # Enable keep_time in the backup section to automatically delete old backups
sudo -u git crontab -e # Edit the crontab for the git user
```

Add the following lines at the bottom:

```
# Create a full backup of the GitLab repositories and SQL database every day at 4am
0 4 * * * cd /home/git/gitlab && PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin bundle exec rake gitlab:backup:create RAILS_ENV=production CRON=1
```

The `CRON=1` environment setting tells the backup script to suppress all progress output if there are no errors.
This is recommended to reduce cron spam.

### For omnibus installations

To schedule a cron job that backs up your repositories and GitLab metadata, use the root user:

```
sudo su -
crontab -e
```

There, add the following line to schedule the backup for everyday at 2 AM:

```
0 2 * * * /opt/gitlab/bin/gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:create CRON=1
```

You may also want to set a limited lifetime for backups to prevent regular
backups using all your disk space.  To do this add the following lines to
`/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and reconfigure:

```
# limit backup lifetime to 7 days - 604800 seconds
gitlab_rails['backup_keep_time'] = 604800
```

NOTE: This cron job does not [backup your omnibus-gitlab configuration](#backup-and-restore-omnibus-gitlab-configuration) or [SSH host keys](https://superuser.com/questions/532040/copy-ssh-keys-from-one-server-to-another-server/532079#532079).

## Alternative backup strategies

If your GitLab server contains a lot of Git repository data you may find the GitLab backup script to be too slow.
In this case you can consider using filesystem snapshots as part of your backup strategy.

Example: Amazon EBS

> A GitLab server using omnibus-gitlab hosted on Amazon AWS.
> An EBS drive containing an ext4 filesystem is mounted at `/var/opt/gitlab`.
> In this case you could make an application backup by taking an EBS snapshot.
> The backup includes all repositories, uploads and Postgres data.

Example: LVM snapshots + rsync

> A GitLab server using omnibus-gitlab, with an LVM logical volume mounted at `/var/opt/gitlab`.
> Replicating the `/var/opt/gitlab` directory using rsync would not be reliable because too many files would change while rsync is running.
> Instead of rsync-ing `/var/opt/gitlab`, we create a temporary LVM snapshot, which we mount as a read-only filesystem at `/mnt/gitlab_backup`.
> Now we can have a longer running rsync job which will create a consistent replica on the remote server.
> The replica includes all repositories, uploads and Postgres data.

If you are running GitLab on a virtualized server you can possibly also create VM snapshots of the entire GitLab server.
It is not uncommon however for a VM snapshot to require you to power down the server, so this approach is probably of limited practical use.
